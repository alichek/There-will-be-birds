              <h2>
                <div class="block mx-4">
                  <p class="my-5">Some people like to look at the birds. Some others take looking at birds seriously and
                    call it birdwatching. And
                    yet some others use their bird watching hobby to help science.
                  </p>
                  <p class="my-5">Managed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, the <a href=ebird.org>eBird</a> project
                    collects information about bird sightings from
                    millions of birdwatchers around the world. The website provides birders with standardized
                    checklists, as well as
                    tools to manage their lists, photos and video recordings. In return, these bird enthusiasts become
                    citizen
                    scientists, helping the eBird team build an invaluable collection of bird sighting data. Over the
                    years this data
                    was used in hundreds of research and conservation projects.
                  </p>
                  <p class="my-5">And while birds do whatever it is that birds do, I wondered if there are patterns in
                    birdwatcher behavior that I
                    could observe. Birds, as far as I know, don’t care whether there is someone observing them through a
                    pair of
                    binoculars, or documenting their behavior. If a bird flaps its wings in the proverbial forest, with
                    no birdwatcher
                    in sight, eBird will never know. So what can we know about the birdwatchers?
                  </p>
                  <p class="my-5">I started by wanting to look at the data for the city of New York. And while the eBird
                    API provides a number of
                    ways to pull the observation data, it has its limitations. I could not easily get what I wanted -
                    how many bird
                    sighting checklists were submitted each day in the city of New York. I had to find a turnaround.
                  </p>
                  <p class="my-5">The API did allow me to ask for daily statistics for any US State, returning the
                    number of submissions,
                    individuals filing submissions and bird species sighted. I decided to combine the sightings for
                    three states: New
                    York, New Jersey and Connecticut. I reasoned that while the state of New York is geographically
                    large, New Jersey
                    and Connecticut are somewhat more compact and close to New York City. The combined population of the
                    three states
                    is about 31 million, while the Tri-State metropolitan area by different estimates contains between
                    20 and 23
                    million inhabitants. And although a large number of bird sightings happen in people’s backyards,
                    birders do travel
                    quite a bit locally for their hobby.
                  </p>
                  <p class="my-5">So while an imperfect substitute, for the purpose of this exercise I believe the
                    combined statistics for the
                    three states should provide a reasonable reflection of what happens in and around New York City,
                    including the
                    effect of local weather phenomena.
                  </p>
                  <p class="my-5">I started by looking at the submissions for the past three months. Noticing that the
                    patterns in the number of
                    contributors closely followed the number submissions, I decided to focus only on the number of
                    submissions.
                  </p>

                </script>
                <p class="my-5">First thing that stood out was one day in May, where observations spiked. There was
                  something special about May
                  13th. It was, what eBird called <a href=https://ebird.org/news/global-big-day-2023>Big Day</a>, a
                  celebration of the semiannual World Migratory Bird
                  Day when their users are encouraged to go out and fill out a few extra submissions. What’s remarkable
                  though, is
                  that the number of different species spotted largely does not depend on the number of birders out that
                  particular day, or the number of
                  submissions to the database. On Big Day, for example, more than twice as many submissions were made as
                  on the next highest
                  submissions day, 8,951 vs 4,454, but only 25 more species were spotted - 521 vs 506.
                </p>
                <p class="my-5">In general, the number of species stays relatively flat despite the spikes in
                  observations. I noticed a definite
                  pattern in the number of submissions, fluctuations defined by seven day intervals. After removing a
                  few days to
                  make the number of weekdays even, I averaged the number of submissions on each day of the week.

                <p class="my-5">I imagine that birds do not have to report to their bosses, submit timecards and abide
                  by deadlines, but many
                  bird watchers definitely do. Wednesdays are the inverted hump days for the birdwatching community.
                </p>
                <p class="my-5">What else do birders have to contend with? How about the weather?
                </p>
                <p class="my-5">While we still see a fair amount of checklists submitted for days with light rain,
                  thunderstorms definitely
                  either bring down the mood of bird watchers or force the birds to hide really well.
                  This is where my analysis gets really shaky, because I can only get the weather for one location. But
                  let’s assume
                  that the population of the Tri-State area should have a sizable effect on the statistics for the three
                  states
                  combined. I used the <a href="https://www.weatherapi.com/">Weather API</a> to check the weather for New York, and averaged across the descriptive
                  conditions
                  for those days.

                <p class="my-5">There was a rather new phenomenon we had to contend with recently in New York, bad air
                  days due to Canadian
                  wildfires. Unfortunately, weatherapi.com does not provide historical air quality data, however I was
                  able to find
                  it at the <a href="https://aqicn.org/historical#!city:usa/newyork">World Air Quality Historical
                    Database</a>.
                </p>
                <div class="block mx-3">
                  <iframe title="Air Quality in New York City" aria-label="Interactive line chart"

                </script>
                <p class="my-5">Thankfully, there were only a few patches of bad air quality days in New York recently,
                  but the drop in bird
                  sighting submissions was noticeable. The numbers for bad days compared to similar days the weeks
                  before or after
                  were 10-20 percent lower. With only a few bad air quality days in recent memory, there is not enough
                  data to go
                  by, but it’s fair to guess that if we continue to suffer from bad air days in New York, the bird
                  watching hobby
                  will suffer along with other outdoor activities, and citizen science with it.
                </p>
                <p class="my-5">One last thing I wanted to look at was the effect of COVID lockdowns on eBird
                  submissions. To do that I needed
                  to ask the API over a thousand times to give me daily statistics for one state (I chose New York). In
                  case I would
                  get denied API access for overtaxing the servers, I left it for last.

                </script>
                <p class="my-5">It appears that in the spring of 2020, eBird started receiving a larger number of
                  submissions from
                  more participants. What’s remarkable is that those numbers have not dropped as COVID lockdowns ended.
                  Birdwatching, it seems, is an enduring hobby.
