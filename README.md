# Watching the Birdwatchers
### A look at birdwatching statistics using the eBird online database.

For this project I used data from a few various sources. Mainly, I used an API for the worldwide birdwatching database eBird.org. I also used weatherAPI to see if there's a corellation between bad weather days and birdwatching. 

Lastly, I wanted to see the effect of bad air days from recent Canadian wildfires. Unfortunately, weatherAPI did not have the air quality information, so I had to find another source for it.
